## Inspiration
- makeathon targeted towards women and nonbinary people
- shared similar experiences about safety while on the go

## What it does
- senses when a person has been following you and alerts you as well as a trusted person about potential danger

## How we built it
- ultrasonic range sensor to measure distance from an object (person in this case) 
- buzzer to alert the user that someone has been within a certain range of them for a certain amount of time
- button to turn off buzzer and notification if false alarm
- timer logic to calculate when someone has been behind you for a certain time + sending messages when the buzzer has went off for 10 seconds

## Challenges we ran into
- coming up with realistic durations of time for when we want a message sent
- making the product durable and transportable
- camera system was buggy

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- making the product into a backpack sort of shape to transport around
- coming up with a catchy name and logo for the product
- creating the timer logic
- integrating IoT with messaging system

## What we learned
- how to work with ESP 32 pinouts (instead of the typical ATmega328P)
- how to think of and go about different safety scenarios in mind and adjusting the product to meet these requirements
- organizing and building an MVP in a short span of time (learning what to prioritize)

## What's next for Swivel
- integrating a camera to take pictures of the culprit and sending to trusted friends
- adjusting buzzer volume level (by using an actual sound sensor)
- finer text messaging system so second text isnt sent if the person isnt in danger
- better range of danger with levels (like high danger ~2m and medium danger ~5m)
